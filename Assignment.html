				Would you believe Apex Legends is almost three years old? When Respawn dropped a spin-off Titanfall Battle Royale without warning back in 2019,
				already feeling like a late contender to PUBG and Fortnite's crowns, it was tempting to write it off as yet another attempt to hop aboard the 
				bandwagon. Hell, it didn't even have wallrunning! But Apex immediately proved itself more than just another gimmicky genre cash-grab. Respawn 
				didn't just translate Titanfall's athletic gunplay into a more measured, tactical battle royaleâ€”it introduced the idea of respawning players 
				mid-match to the genre, and boasted an incredible, accessible ping system(opens in new tab) that still hasn't been topped. Nearly three years 
				on, Apex hasn't just cemented its place next to Warzone and Fortnite at the top of the battle royale table. It's grown into one of the best 
				multiplayer shooters you can play today.</i></font>
