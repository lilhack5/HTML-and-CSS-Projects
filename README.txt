 Apex page
 
 ### Movie Theatre Site
 
 This page was made using bootsrap and shows a style of a form and dropdowns.
 
 ### One page Website
 
 With this page I used dog pictures and embed dog vidoes with a nave bar. Styled with CSS.
 
 ### Sharks page
 I used this as a chance to show some of the San Jose Sharks that are on the team this year. It is styled 
 with CSS and has a navbar, imagine containers and a form.
 
 ### Apex page
 This was one of my first pages done in 20 years. I used some older code mixed with some new code. I embed a video
 a link to another website and a footer to go between a couple mixed pages.
