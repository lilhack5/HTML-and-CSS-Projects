## Projects

Movie Theater Site

With this page I used bootstrap to make my webpage that contains a navbar, imagage
containers and a form.

Dog Page

I made a one page website that utitlized embeded videos and links to navigate through 
the site. I used pictures and a form as well.

Sharks Page

I used some of  the players from the San Jose Sharks to use as thumbnails. I also 
used a picture in the background using css. A fixed navbar to jump to the different 
areas on the site and a form to contact someone.

Apex Legends Page

I used an embeded video of my favorite steamer and a link to his twitch page. I used
some old code from what I knew from 20 years ago to style it best I could.
